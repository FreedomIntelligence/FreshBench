The outcome will be determined using the S&P 500 - Weighted Estimated Earnings dated 29 December 2023 as reported here. The chart will be updated with data on or about the 15th of each month.For this question, please enter your forecast as three earnings per share (EPS) estimates (specific values, not probabilities). Think of the middle number as your base case, or central forecast, with the others as your bull (top) and bear (bottom) scenarios.

You may do so either using the “Chart Input” or the “Text Input”; please see the buttons under the ribbon that starts with “Forecast”. For the Chart Input, you can drag the three dots for 2023 to the positions you consider appropriate; a brief explanation about each dot will pop up when you hover your cursor over them. For the Text Input, you can type in your three value estimates.

Technically, your top estimate should be the number you are 90% confident the ultimate outcome value will be less than or equal to, and your bottom estimate should be the number you are 90% confident the ultimate outcome will be greater than or equal to. For example, if your base case is 200, enter that number in the middle; if you are 90% confident the outcome will be less than or equal to 300, enter that number at the top; and, finally, if you are 90% confident the outcome will be greater than or equal to 100, enter that number at the bottom.Confused?

Offtake agreements between hydrogen producers and energy consumers are seen as key for the growth of the hydrogen industry (World Economic Forum, Investopedia - Offtake Agreement). Natural gas-based hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage is referred to as blue hydrogen (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). For the purposes of this question, “industrial customer” means a recipient of blue hydrogen as part of the processing, producing, or assembling of goods, including the manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and construction industries (EPA). The point of delivery must be in the US to count, and the date of delivery would be immaterial. The signing of an agreement must be made public before 1 October 2023 to count, and an announcement of the agreement by either party would count.Confused? Check our FAQ or ask us for help.

Question clarification

Issued on 06/04/20 12:56pm
          GJ Open does not consider the May announcement of the continuation of a curfew in Mecca as it applies to pilgrimages through 21 June, which was in place prior to the launch of this question, to be a de facto announcement by Saudi Arabia about the cancellation or suspension of the Hajj pilgrimage scheduled for 28 July to 2 August 2020.

Egypt's economy has sputtered since 2011 despite billions of dollars in aid from neighboring states; the promise of a three-year, $12-billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund -- and the reforms that loan would require -- are spurring optimism among some observers and pessimism among others (NY Times, Financial Times, Reuters). Question will be resolved using data from Egypt's Central Bank, which releases monthly data on real sector growth (Central Bank of Egypt). You can find the relevant table by clicking on the "Real Sector" Excel sheet and looking at Tab 44 "GDP by Expenditure (Constant Prices)." The relevant figure for this question is on the "GDP at Market Prices" row, and the column labeled 2016/2017 under "Growth Rate %". Question will be suspended on 30 June 2017, the end of Egypt's fiscal 2016/2017 fiscal year, and closed when the data is released, typically in early December.

The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 March 2018 and will be resolved in January 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Turkey from January 2018 through December 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See here for GJÍs FAQ on forecasting questions like this.

See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See here for GJÍs FAQ on forecasting questions like this.

The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 March 2018 and will be resolved in January 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Iraq from January 2018 through December 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns.

This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 September 2018 and will be resolved in July 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in the Philippines from July 2018 to June 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (EWP) for examples. See (GJOpen) for GJ’s FAQ on forecasting questions like this.

Terance Gamble was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm by both the State of Alabama and the federal government (SCOTUSBlog). He appealed his federal conviction, arguing that being prosecuted for the same crime by two courts violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Constitution Center).  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed his conviction, noting that the Supreme Court had ruled “that prosecution in federal and state court for the same conduct does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the state and federal governments are 'separate sovereigns' (SCOTUSBlog).”  The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its current term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. See our FAQ to learn about how we resolve questions and how scores are calculated.The question closed "No" with a closing date of 17 June 2019 (SCOTUS).  See our FAQ to learn about how we resolve questions and how scores are calculated..

In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns.
